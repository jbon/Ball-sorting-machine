# Ball-sorting-machine


The purpose of this machine is to sort a set of balls according to their weight. The tracks of balls are linked to seesaws, which allow to send the heavier ball on one track underneath and the lighter ball on another one. Balls arrive in ''huts'' and are then lined up and sorted.

At this stage, two problems have to be considered and solved during the design process: 

Problem 1: Construction of the seesaws: the heavier ball  can arrive on any one of the seesaw sides, it must however be placed on the same track at the exit
