The purpose of this machine is to sort a set of balls according to their weight. The balls are placed in a release mechanism  which allows them to be released into the tubes. Once they reach the seasaw a comparison will take place which means the heavier ball will be sent into one tube and the lighter one to another. At the end the balls arrive in''huts'' and are lined up and sorted.

During the desing process different problems  must be taken into consideration and solved :


Problem 1: Construction of the seesaws: the heavier ball can arrive on any one of the seesaw sides, it must however leave again towards the exit of the same track. 

Problem 2: The sorting process must not start before both balls are in place. Otherwise, the first ball that arrives will be considered to be the heavier, and the second will not be any more in circuit. 

Problem 3: It is very important that the technical solutions are  simple enough so that the mechanical automatic aspect of this sorting remains visible. 

The machine is composed of 3 main parts: 

1. The release mechanism [I'm an inline-style link](https://github.com/saharbha/Ball-sorting-machine/wiki/1.Release-mechanism)

2. The balance : The placement of the balances is not relative. [I'm an inline-style link](https://github.com/saharbha/Ball-sorting-machine/wiki/2.The-balance)

3. Container [I'm an inline-style link](https://github.com/saharbha/Ball-sorting-machine/wiki/3.-The-container)
