# Ball-sorting-machine


The purpose of this machine is to sort a set of balls according to their weight. The tracks of balls are linked to seesaws, which allow to send the heavier ball on one track underneath and the lighter ball on another one. Balls arrive in ''huts'' and are then lined up and sorted.

Different problems have to be considered and solved during the design process: 

Problem 1: Construction of the seesaws: the heavier ball  can arrive on any one of the seesaw sides, it must however be placed on the same track at the exit. 

Problem 2: it is always necessary to keep enough slope so that balls do not stop. 

Problem 3: What to do so that seesaws do not start before both balls get there. Otherwise, it is always the first arrived ball that will be considered to be the heaviest, and the second will not be any more in circuit. 

Problem 4: It is very important that found technical solutions  be simple enough so that the mechanical, automatic aspect of this sorting remains visible.
