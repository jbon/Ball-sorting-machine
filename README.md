# Ball-sorting-machine

The purpose of this machine is to sort a set of balls according to their weight. The tracks of balls are linked to seesaws, which allow to send the heavier ball on one track underneath and the lighter ball on another one. Balls arrive in ''huts'' and are then lined up and sorted.
