I) Balance: 

-	The screws function is to release the balance for the nodes at that level.

-	Stabilizing the Balance: the profile is asymetric so that it comes back to its original position on its own. 

-	An asymmetric profile generates a bigger torque either on the side turned away from the wind or on the wind of the turned side, that's why the more asymmetric it is, the heavier the balls must be.

-	Description of Section J-J: 
The surface where the ball will take position is not a flat surface so that the ball doesn't  fall down.  For this we considered 2 features during this stage of design: 
1) The corners of the profile are sharp. 
2) The surface is a little bit curved.
